# Pro Rescue Solution
This solution is based on 2 output channels i.e.,web and mobile and one input channel i.e.,fire, gas and water sensor.
The flow in brief is the sensor takes the on field reading from the sensors and hits an api to post the readings, these readings are stored in a mongodb database which is get by the mobile and the web devices to show the areas affected by disaster and navigate the rescue team to the help areas.
Kindly read the App Documentation flow for further features that are used in this project like on-field data reading, svg graphs, map-clustering, map navigation and many more.
